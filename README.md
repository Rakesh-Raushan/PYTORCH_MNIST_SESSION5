# Usage

## How to Use

This section provides an overview of how to use the files in your GitHub repository and explains the purpose and functionality of each file.

### 1. model.py

#### Description

The `model.py` file contains the PyTorch code for training an MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) model using a convolutional neural network (ConvNet). This file primarily focuses on defining the architecture and training the model.

#### Usage

To use the `model.py` file:

1. Ensure that you have PyTorch installed.
2. Import the necessary packages and modules in your Python script or notebook.
3. Create an instance of the MNIST model defined in `model.py`.
4. Set up the data loaders to load the MNIST dataset.
5. Train the model using the provided training loop or customize it as needed.

The `model.py` file serves as the backbone for training an MNIST model using ConvNet architecture and can be modified to experiment with different model configurations and hyperparameters.

### 2. utils.py

#### Description

The `utils.py` file contains various utility functions and data loaders that complement the functionality of the MNIST model. It provides the following features:

- Data loaders: These functions facilitate loading the MNIST dataset, preparing it for training, and providing convenient access to the data.
- Visualization functions: These functions allow you to visualize sample images from the MNIST dataset, helping you understand the data distribution and verify preprocessing steps.
- Training metrics: The `utils.py` file includes functions for printing and tracking training metrics such as loss, accuracy, and other evaluation metrics during the training process.

#### Usage

By importing and utilizing the functions in `utils.py`, you can streamline your workflow when working with the MNIST dataset and the associated model training.

### 3. S5.ipynb

#### Description

The `S5.ipynb` notebook is an example code file that demonstrates how to use the `model.py` and `utils.py` files together to train an MNIST model. It provides a complete pipeline for training the model and showcases the functionalities of both the model architecture and utility functions.

#### Usage

To use the `S5.ipynb` notebook:

1. Open the notebook in a compatible environment, such as Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Make sure that the `model.py` and `utils.py` files are present in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Run the code cells in sequential order to execute the training process.
4. Customize the code as needed, such as modifying hyperparameters, adjusting the model architecture, or adding additional evaluation steps.

The `S5.ipynb` notebook serves as a practical example of how to utilize the provided model and utility files to train an MNIST model effectively.

## Model Summary

This section provides a summary of the MNIST model implemented in `model.py` and its key components.

The MNIST model employs a ConvNet architecture specifically designed for image classification tasks. Although the exact details of the model's architecture may vary depending on the specific implementation, the general structure typically consists of the following components:

1. Convolutional layers: These layers perform feature extraction by applying a set of learnable filters to the input image, capturing different visual patterns at multiple scales. Each convolutional layer is typically followed by a non-linear activation function.
2. Pooling layers: These layers downsample the feature maps generated by the convolutional layers, reducing spatial dimensions while retaining essential information. Common pooling operations include max pooling or average pooling.
3. Fully connected layers: After the convolutional and pooling layers, the extracted features are flattened and passed through one or more fully connected layers. These layers learn to classify the input image based on the extracted features.
4. Output layer: The final layer of the model produces the desired output, which, in the case of MNIST, is a probability distribution over the ten possible
